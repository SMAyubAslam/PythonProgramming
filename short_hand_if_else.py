'''
If ... Else in One Line
There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement 
that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short. 
Here's an example:
'''
# a = 303
# b = 420

# print("A") if a>b else print("B")

'''
You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:

Example
One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:
'''
# a = 330
# b = 330
# print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")
